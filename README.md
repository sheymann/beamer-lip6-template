Free and open-source template for **beamer**, which is a LaTeX package for typesetting presentation slides. The theme is designed for use at Universit√© Pierre et Marie Curie (UPMC), [LIP6](http://www.lip6.fr/), and is derived from the amazing [Frederiksberg](http://matdat.life.ku.dk/LaTeX/Frederiksberg/) theme. If you're not from this university, you must change the color scheme and logos.

This template is distributed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/sheymann/beamer-lip6-template/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).
